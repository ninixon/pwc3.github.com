  </div>
    <div class="date">Published January 28, 2013</div>
  <p>Since the Dropbox client software installed on my computer never seems to
automatically update, I wrote a Python script to do it for me. It was developed
and tested under Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2.</p>
<p>The script does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Checks <code>/Applications/Dropbox.app</code> for the currently-installed version
   number.</li>
<li>Checks <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/install">http://www.dropbox.com/install</a> for
   the "latest available version" (i.e., whichever version is listed on the
   <em>Download</em> button, which may or may not be the latest available version).</li>
<li>If the installed version number is less than the latest available version,
   it attempts to download a DMG of the latest version to <code>~/Downloads</code>.</li>
<li>If a DMG was successfully downloaded, the script then mounts the DMG and
   runs the installer.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several assumptions made in the script. I tried to document them all
and use easily-modifiable constants wherever possible. If the script fails, one
of the assumptions may no longer be valid.</p>
<p>There are two command-line options (run with <code>--help</code> for details). The
<code>-v</code>/<code>--version</code> option allows you to specify the version to install. This is
useful when installing Forum builds. The <code>-d</code>/<code>--dry-run</code> option performs a
"dry run" which downloads the DMG but does not mount it or run the installer.</p>
<p>The script requires the <code>beautifulsoup4</code> module. It is used to scrape the
Dropbox download page to determine the version number. It can be installed via
either <code>pip install beautifulsoup4</code> or <code>easy_install beautifulsoup4</code>.</p>
<p>The script is available for download <a href="http://github.com/pwc3/dropbox-updater">on Github</a>.</p>

    <a href="/archives/2013/1/new_blogging_setup.html">New Blogging Setup</a>
  </div>
    <div class="date">Published January 28, 2013</div>
  <p>My blog posts come pretty intermittently. I most recently tried using an <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blog hosted at <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> for a while. I got it set up, made a handful of posts over about a week, and then stopped.</p>
<p>Recently, I had a few blog ideas and went back to try to make some more posts. I'm not sure what I did, but over the past five months, I managed to break my setup. My familiarity with Ruby is pretty limited, so I couldn't easily diagnose the issue.</p>
<p>So, I started looking at some of other static blogging setups that are comparable to Octopress. <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> was my first choice, as I do a lot of Python development for my day job. The setup was fairly easy, but the output looked bad. I couldn't find a Pelican theme that didn't look awful.</p>
<p>After that, I took a look at <a href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin</a> and <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogram</a>. Both are static blogging engines powered by <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. I liked them both, but neither were exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I had been considering buying a copy of <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad</a> from <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/">Flying Meat</a> for a while now. I like the idea of keeping my notes in a wiki format. When I found out that <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/docs/static%20publishing.html">static blogging was recently added</a>, I thought I'd give it a try.</p>
<p>I really liked what I saw. It's convenient enough, fits my workflow, supports <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and gives me enough flexibility in page generation. So, I bought a license and will see how it goes.</p>
<p>I post a lot of code samples, and I wanted decent syntax highlighting in the generated pages. Adding <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/">Highlight.js</a> was pretty simple.</p>
<p>As for hosting, I decided to give <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> a try. After some confusion about <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">user and project pages</a>, I got it up and running.</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>

  </div>
    <div class="date">Published January 27, 2013</div>
  <p>Here's a dead simple <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> snippet that I use quite a bit.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash
pbpaste | %fill:filter%
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to set the Content to <code>Shell Script</code>. I have this set to fire when I
type <code>;pipe</code>.</p>
<p>When it fires, a dialog is presented allowing you to fill in whatever you want
where the <code>%fill:filter%</code> appears. It takes the contents of the pasteboard and
runs it through an arbitrary Unix pipeline. You can enter a single command,
(like <code>tr a-z A-Z</code>) or a pipeline of commands (like <code>sort | uniq -c</code>). The
contents of the pasteboard are passed through whatever set of commands you
specify and the result is substituted to wherever you were typing.</p>

  </div>
    <div class="date">Published August 15, 2012</div>
  <p>Sometimes, the output of <code>svn diff</code> doesn't quite cut it. Sometimes, you want to see a side-by-side comparison of the full files. The <code>--diff-cmd</code> flag lets you specify an external diff program:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">svn diff --diff-cmd=fmdiff
</code></pre>

<p>This requires <code>fmdiff</code>, which is available <a href="http://www.defraine.net/~brunod/fmdiff/">from the developer's website</a> or via <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>. It will show a diff of the entire file in FileMerge.</p>
<p>I use this frequently enough that I added an alias to it in my <code>.bashrc</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="sh">alias svndiff='svn diff --diff-cmd=fmdiff'
</code></pre>

  <p><a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/textexpander">TextExpander</a> is one of the first apps I install on a new computer. It's great for abbreviating repeatedly-typed strings. It also is capable of doing simple date arithmetic. Here are some examples I use regularly.</p>
<table>

<th>Abbreviation</th>
<th>Expansion</th>
<th>Example</th>

<tbody>

<td><code>%@-1D%Y-%m-%d</code></td>
<td><code>2012-08-12</code></td>
</tr>

<td><code>%Y-%m-%d</code></td>
<td><code>2012-08-13</code></td>
