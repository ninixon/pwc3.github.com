    <div class="date">Published January 28, 2013</div>
  <p>My blog posts come pretty intermittently. I most recently tried using an <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blog hosted at <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> for a while. I got it set up, made a handful of posts over about a week, and then stopped.</p>
<p>Recently, I had a few blog ideas and went back to try to make some more posts. I'm not sure what I did, but over the past five months, I managed to break my setup. My familiarity with Ruby is pretty limited, so I couldn't easily diagnose the issue.</p>
<p>So, I started looking at some of other static blogging setups that are comparable to Octopress. <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> was my first choice, as I do a lot of Python development for my day job. The setup was fairly easy, but the output looked bad. I couldn't find a Pelican theme that didn't look awful.</p>
<p>After that, I took a look at <a href="http://calepin.co/">Calepin</a> and <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogram</a>. Both are static blogging engines powered by <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. I liked them both, but neither were exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I had been considering buying a copy of <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad</a> from <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/">Flying Meat</a> for a while now. I like the idea of keeping my notes in a wiki format. When I found out that <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/docs/static%20publishing.html">static blogging was recently added</a>, I thought I'd give it a try.</p>
<p>I really liked what I saw. It's convenient enough, fits my workflow, supports <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and gives me enough flexibility in page generation. So, I bought a license and will see how it goes.</p>
<p>I post a lot of code samples, and I wanted decent syntax highlighting in the generated pages. Adding <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/">Highlight.js</a> was pretty simple.</p>
<p>As for hosting, I decided to give <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> a try. After some confusion about <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages">user and project pages</a>, I got it up and running.</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
