    <a href="/archives/2013/8/pause_when_dialing_a_skype_number.html">Pause When Dialing a Skype Number</a>
  </div>
    <div class="date">Published August 15, 2013</div>
  <p>One of my clients uses a phone bridge for conference calls. I usually call in to the bridge using Skype. Each regular conference call I have uses a different access code. It works like an extension number: you call the bridge, wait a few seconds, dial the access code, press <code>#</code>, wait a few seconds, and press <code>#</code> again.</p>
<p>On a cell phone, you can usually add commas to the phone number to insert a pause when dialing, allowing you to save extensions and access codes like this in the contact information. Of course, Skype doesn't support that.</p>
<p>I found an <a href="http://community.skype.com/t5/Mac/Re-Pause-option-when-dialing/td-p/731820">AppleScript on a Skype discussion board</a> that shows a way to dial a number using Skype followed by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dtmf">DTMF</a> string to be sent after the call connects. I wrote a Python wrapper for it. Commas are interpreted as 2 second delays.</p>
<p>Now, I can call the phone bridge and dial the access code all with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">$ skypecall 800-555-1212 &quot;12345#,,#&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This dials the number <code>+18005551212</code>, waits for the call to connect, waits 10 seconds, then dials the string <code>12345#</code>, waits 4 seconds, then dials <code>#</code>.</p>
<p>Here's the Python script:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pwc3/6246835.js"></script>

<p>It's fairly easy to go from that to any of a number of shortcuts (Alfred, LaunchBar, an Automator action, etc.) to quickly place a call.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I created an Alfred Keyword action named <code>bridge</code> which triggers a shell script that looks like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pwc3/6246974.js"></script>

<p>The <code>case</code> statement maps from keyword arguments (<code>monday</code>, <code>wednesday</code>, or <code>friday</code> in this example) into access codes (<code>12345</code>, <code>23456</code>, or <code>34567</code> respectively). To run it, I invoke Alfred (<code>Cmd-Space</code> on my computer) then I type:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">bridge monday
</code></pre>

<p>This causes Skype to dial <code>+18005551212</code>, and enters the access code <code>12345</code> with the right pauses and <code>#</code>s. If I wanted to use an arbitrary access code that doesn't have a corresponding keyword, I could do so like this:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">bridge 24680
</code></pre>

  <p>Occasionally, I've wanted to be able to poke around in a plist file while working in the terminal. You can open an XML plist in a text editor like Vim, but a binary plist just looks like gibberish.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you can convert a plist file into XML format with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">plutil -convert xml1 INPUT_FILENAME
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can convert a plist file into binary format with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">plutil -convert binary1 INPUT_FILENAME
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, change <code>INPUT_FILENAME</code> to whatever file you want to edit.</p>
<p>I wrote a quick Python script to automate this. I called it <code>edit-plist</code>. It first checks the file type (using the <code>file</code> utility). If it's a binary plist, it converts to XML. Then it opens in the selected editor (Vim). Once the editor exits, if the file was originally a binary plist, it converts back to that format.</p>

    <a href="/archives/2013/8/copy_to_pasteboard_from_a_remote_machine.html">Copy to Pasteboard from a Remote Machine</a>
  </div>
    <div class="date">Published August 2, 2013</div>
  <p>I do a lot of work via SSH on a remote Linux server. It is often useful to transfer text from that server back to my local machine. Rather than save to a file and <code>scp</code> it down to my local machine, I <a href="http://seancoates.com/blogs/remote-pbcopy">adapted this process</a> to allow me to copy to my local pasteboard from a remote machine.</p>
<p>Note, I use port 50730 for this. I can't remember why I picked that number. Regardless, it's arbitrary and you should be able to choose something else if you prefer.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create a pasteboard daemon</h3>
<p>On Mac OS X, this is fairly easy using a Launch Agent.</p>
<p>Save the following XML property list file in <code>~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.paulcalnan.pbcopy.plist</code> on your local machine:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pwc3/6759682.js"></script>

<p>Note that I use my domain name, <code>com.paulcalnan</code>, in the daemon and file name. You can call it whatever you like.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Load the daemon</h3>
<p>From the Terminal on your local machine, run:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.paulcalnan.pbcopy.plist
</code></pre>

<h3>Step 3: Configure SSH port forwarding</h3>
<p>Add the following to your local machine's <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">RemoteForward 50730 127.0.0.1:50730
</code></pre>

<h3>Step 4: Create a remote <code>pbcopy</code> script</h3>
<p>Add the following file to the remote server as <code>~/bin/pbcopy</code> and make it executable:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash
cat | nc localhost 50730
</code></pre>

<p>This assumes <code>~/bin</code> is on your <code>PATH</code>. If the remote host runs OS X, you should name it something else, like <code>rpbcopy</code>, to prevent confusion with the built-in <code>pbcopy</code>.</p>
<h3>Step 5: Try it out</h3>
<p>From the remote server, run a command and pipe the output through <code>pbcopy</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">uptime | pbcopy
</code></pre>

<p>Back on your local machine, paste into a text editor.</p>
<h3>Bonus <code>tmux</code> Trick</h3>
<p>Most of the time, I use <code>tmux</code> to manage multiple consoles in the same SSH session. When I split the window horizontally, it breaks my ability to select multiple lines of text with the mouse.</p>
<p>To copy from a tmux session, I do a <code>Ctrl-A [</code>, select text I want to copy, and press <code>Enter</code> (I use <code>Ctrl-A</code> instead of <code>Ctrl-B</code> for my prefix). That puts the selected text in the tmux buffer. To copy the tmux buffer contents, I run <code>tmuxcp</code>, defined as an alias in my <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">alias tmuxcp='tmux save-buffer - | pbcopy'
</code></pre>

<p>This works on Linux (where I have my <code>pbcopy</code> script on my path) and on OS X (which has the native <code>pbcopy</code> on the path).</p>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>I use this quite often and it's turned out to be a huge time saver. It's not perfect, though. There are two issues I have encountered.</p>
<p>First, it doesn't work if you open multiple SSH sessions to the same server. After one session is opened, subsequent sessions print a warning:</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">Warning: remote port forwarding failed for listen port 50730
</code></pre>

<p>This can cause other issues. For instance, I have a particular Linux host I connect to via SSH that also runs a MySQL instance. if I have an SSH session open to that host and then use MySQL Workbench (or some other MySQL graphical client) to open an SSH connection to that same host, the warning message is incorrectly interpreted as an error message and the connection fails. The workaround here is to open the MySQL connection first and then open the SSH connection. The port forwarding will fail in the SSH session, preventing the remote <code>pbcopy</code> from working, but the MySQL connection will work.</p>
<p>Second, it doesn't handle text encoding particularly well. When I pass UTF-8 text into the remote <code>pbcopy</code> script, it shows up on the local pasteboard garbled. This shouldn't be too hard to fix, but I don't run into it often enough to spend the time debugging it.</p>

  <p>Someone posted to Twitter a link to <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter/iter.html">a presentation on Python iteration</a>. In it, I saw something clever.</p>
<p>When iterating over a file line-by-line, you generally do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="python">with open(some_filename, 'r') as fh:
    for line in fh:
        do_something_interesting(line)
</code></pre>

<p>Occasionally, you need a line number associated with each line of data. I usually wind up doing something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="python">with open(some_filename, 'r') as fh:
    lineno = 0
    for line in fh:
        lineno += 1
        do_something_interesting(line, lineno)
</code></pre>

<p>From the presentation, I learned that you can do the same with the <code>enumerate</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="python">with open(some_filename, 'r') as fh:
    for lineno, line in enumerate(fh, start=1):
        do_something_interesting(line, lineno)
</code></pre>

<p>I can't believe that never occurred to me before.</p>

    <a href="/archives/2013/4/exchange_to_icloud_calendar_sync.html">Exchange to iCloud Calendar Sync</a>
  </div>
    <div class="date">Published April 8, 2013</div>
  <p>I recently received an email from a client of mine. They decided to block all iOS 6.1.3 users from syncing with the corporate Exchange server. This isn't a problem with email as I was able to configure IMAP easily. This was, however, a big problem for my calendar. Being unable to have an up-to-date schedule on my iPhone was out of the question.</p>
<p>I first looked at <a href="http://davmail.sourceforge.net/">DavMail</a> but couldn't get it to work. Instead I decided to make a duplicate of my Exchange calendar in iCloud.</p>
<p>(Update 2013-04-16) This wound up causing lots of problems with iCloud. Around when the script ran, I noticed in Console.app reports of the <code>CalendarAgent</code> process crashing repeatedly every few seconds. I'm not sure why, and didn't really dig too deeply to find out. Fortunately, my client re-enabled iOS syncing with Exchange, so the need for this script has gone away.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create a new iCloud calendar</h3>
<p>In Calendar.app (formerly iCal) on OS X, create a new calendar (File &gt; New Calendar &gt; iCloud). Call it whatever you like.</p>
<p>(Update 2013-04-09) You'll want to Ignore Alerts on this calendar on your computer. Otherwise you'll get double alerts for every event. Right-click the calendar in the list and select Get Info. Check the <em>Ignore Alerts</em> checkbox and click OK.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Create an AppleScript</h3>
<p>The pivotal piece here is an AppleScript that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deletes all events from the destination iCloud calendar (created in Step 1 above).</li>
<li>Copies all events from your Exchange calendar to the iCloud calendar.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this example, we'll call the Exchange calendar "Source Calendar" and the iCloud calendar "Destination Calendar".</p>
<p>We first delete all of the events from the destination calendar. We're not <em>really</em> syncing the calendars, rather we're copying all events from one to another. If we didn't delete first, events removed from the source calendar would never be removed from the destination calendar. Just be careful to use the right calendar names so you don't accidentally delete from wrong one!</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pwc3/5342337.js"></script>

<p>Copy and paste the script above into the AppleScript Editor (usually found in /Applications/Utilities) and change the calendar names as necessary. Try it out and make sure you don't get any error messages. Save it someplace convenient and remember where you put it.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Schedule the script to run</h3>
<p>This step is optional. If you prefer, you can just run the script whenever you think of it. I decided to schedule it using Cron. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">This Wikipedia article</a> provides a reasonable rundown of how Cron works, if you're unfamiliar with it.</p>
<p>In the Terminal, run:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">crontab -e
</code></pre>

<p>This will launch a text editor. In it, you specify the schedule. In my case, I wanted to run it every two hours, Monday through Friday.</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">* */2 * * 1-5 osascript $HOME/Dropbox/Scripts/Applications/Calendar/Exchange\ Sync.scpt
</code></pre>

<p>Change the path to your AppleScript to match where you put it in Step 2.</p>
<p>(Apparently, you can wrap an AppleScript with an Automator workflow and <a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050504105901868">schedule it to run using Calendar.app</a>, but I haven't tried this approach.)</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>On a relatively new MacBook Pro, the script takes a couple of minutes to sync around 200 events. Presumably fewer events will sync faster. It may take a couple of minutes for the iCloud sync to go through before you see the events on your iOS device.</p>
<p>The script is pretty basic. I was going to make the sync go incrementally, but AppleScript is such a pain to program, I decided to go the naive route and just delete everything and copy it back over.</p>
