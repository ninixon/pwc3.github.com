  </div>
    <div class="date">Published August 2, 2013</div>
  <p>Someone posted to Twitter a link to <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter/iter.html">a presentation on Python iteration</a>. In it, I saw something clever.</p>
<p>When iterating over a file line-by-line, you generally do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="python">with open(some_filename, 'r') as fh:
    for line in fh:
        do_something_interesting(line)
</code></pre>

<p>Occasionally, you need a line number associated with each line of data. I usually wind up doing something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="python">with open(some_filename, 'r') as fh:
    lineno = 0
    for line in fh:
        lineno += 1
        do_something_interesting(line, lineno)
</code></pre>

<p>From the presentation, I learned that you can do the same with the <code>enumerate</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="python">with open(some_filename, 'r') as fh:
    for lineno, line in enumerate(fh, start=1):
        do_something_interesting(line, lineno)
</code></pre>

<p>I can't believe that never occurred to me before.</p>

    <a href="/archives/2013/4/exchange_to_icloud_calendar_sync.html">Exchange to iCloud Calendar Sync</a>
  </div>
    <div class="date">Published April 8, 2013</div>
  <p>I recently received an email from a client of mine. They decided to block all iOS 6.1.3 users from syncing with the corporate Exchange server. This isn't a problem with email as I was able to configure IMAP easily. This was, however, a big problem for my calendar. Being unable to have an up-to-date schedule on my iPhone was out of the question.</p>
<p>I first looked at <a href="http://davmail.sourceforge.net/">DavMail</a> but couldn't get it to work. Instead I decided to make a duplicate of my Exchange calendar in iCloud.</p>
<p>(Update 2013-04-16) This wound up causing lots of problems with iCloud. Around when the script ran, I noticed in Console.app reports of the <code>CalendarAgent</code> process crashing repeatedly every few seconds. I'm not sure why, and didn't really dig too deeply to find out. Fortunately, my client re-enabled iOS syncing with Exchange, so the need for this script has gone away.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create a new iCloud calendar</h3>
<p>In Calendar.app (formerly iCal) on OS X, create a new calendar (File &gt; New Calendar &gt; iCloud). Call it whatever you like.</p>
<p>(Update 2013-04-09) You'll want to Ignore Alerts on this calendar on your computer. Otherwise you'll get double alerts for every event. Right-click the calendar in the list and select Get Info. Check the <em>Ignore Alerts</em> checkbox and click OK.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Create an AppleScript</h3>
<p>The pivotal piece here is an AppleScript that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deletes all events from the destination iCloud calendar (created in Step 1 above).</li>
<li>Copies all events from your Exchange calendar to the iCloud calendar.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this example, we'll call the Exchange calendar "Source Calendar" and the iCloud calendar "Destination Calendar".</p>
<p>We first delete all of the events from the destination calendar. We're not <em>really</em> syncing the calendars, rather we're copying all events from one to another. If we didn't delete first, events removed from the source calendar would never be removed from the destination calendar. Just be careful to use the right calendar names so you don't accidentally delete from wrong one!</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pwc3/5342337.js"></script>

<p>Copy and paste the script above into the AppleScript Editor (usually found in /Applications/Utilities) and change the calendar names as necessary. Try it out and make sure you don't get any error messages. Save it someplace convenient and remember where you put it.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Schedule the script to run</h3>
<p>This step is optional. If you prefer, you can just run the script whenever you think of it. I decided to schedule it using Cron. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">This Wikipedia article</a> provides a reasonable rundown of how Cron works, if you're unfamiliar with it.</p>
<p>In the Terminal, run:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">crontab -e
</code></pre>

<p>This will launch a text editor. In it, you specify the schedule. In my case, I wanted to run it every two hours, Monday through Friday.</p>
<pre><code class="no-highlight">* */2 * * 1-5 osascript $HOME/Dropbox/Scripts/Applications/Calendar/Exchange\ Sync.scpt
</code></pre>

<p>Change the path to your AppleScript to match where you put it in Step 2.</p>
<p>(Apparently, you can wrap an AppleScript with an Automator workflow and <a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050504105901868">schedule it to run using Calendar.app</a>, but I haven't tried this approach.)</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>On a relatively new MacBook Pro, the script takes a couple of minutes to sync around 200 events. Presumably fewer events will sync faster. It may take a couple of minutes for the iCloud sync to go through before you see the events on your iOS device.</p>
<p>The script is pretty basic. I was going to make the sync go incrementally, but AppleScript is such a pain to program, I decided to go the naive route and just delete everything and copy it back over.</p>
<p>As usual, <a href="http://twitter.com/pwc/">questions and feedback are always welcome</a>.</p>

  </div>
    <div class="date">Published March 4, 2013</div>
  <p>I recently bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Touch-light/dp/B007OZNZG0">Kindle Paperwhite</a>. I used to own a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Special-Offers-Wireless-Reader/dp/B004HFS6Z0">Kindle Keyboard</a> and was pleasantly surprised by the updated features on the new model. </p>
<p>One of the features I really like is the estimated time printed at the bottom of the screen. You can toggle between time left in the current chapter and time left in the book. When you first use the Kindle, it doesn't immediately show you those values. Rather, it watches how fast you read and adjusts the estimates accordingly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's easily confused. I'm reading a book with lots of footnotes, and I occasionally flip around. Rapidly changing pages appears to confuse the time estimate calculations. After a while, it was estimating I'd finish the book in one hour, even though I was at the 8% mark of a 1000+ page book.</p>
<p>Luckily, I found an easy way to reset the estimate. Search for <code>;ReadingTimeReset</code> (keep the semicolon and capitalization as shown) and the estimate will be reset.</p>
<p>A couple of other miscellaneous thoughts on the Paperwhite:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was initially disappointed by the uneven backlight at the bottom of the screen. After a couple hours of use, I found that I had the light turned on too high. Lowering the light intensity makes the unevenness less apparent while keeping the screen legible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once I decided to keep the Paperwhite, paying the extra $20 to get rid of the ads (or "Unsubscribe from Special Offers" in marketing-speak) was a no-brainer.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  </div>
    <div class="date">Published February 15, 2013</div>
  <p>My Bash prompt has progressively gotten more complicated over the years. Today, I wanted to add to it and realized it was time to reorganize.</p>
<p>Prior to today, it looked like this:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">export PS1=&quot;\n\[\e[0;33m\]\D{%a %b %d %T %Z %Y}\[\e[0;34m\]\$(__git_ps1)\n\[\e[0;31m\]\u@\h\[\e[0m\]: \[\e[0;36m\]\w\[\e[0m\]\n$ &quot;
</code></pre>

<p>After today's reorganization, it now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">__pyenv_prompt()
{
    if [ &quot;$VIRTUAL_ENV&quot; != &quot;&quot; ]; then
        echo -n &quot;$(basename $VIRTUAL_ENV) &quot;
    fi
}

__PS1_DTS=&quot;\[\e[0;33m\]\D{%a %b %d %T %Z %Y}&quot;
__PS1_PYENV=&quot;\[\e[1;35m\]\$(__pyenv_prompt)&quot;

if [ -e &quot;$__RVM_HOME/bin/rvm-prompt&quot; ]; then
    __PS1_RVM=&quot;\[\e[0;31m\]\$(rvm-prompt i v p g)&quot;
fi

__PS1_USERNAME=&quot;\[\e[0;31m\]\u@\h\[\e[0m\]: &quot;
__PS1_PWD=&quot;\[\e[0;36m\]\w\[\e[0m\]&quot;

export PS1=&quot;\n${__PS1_DTS}${__PS1_GITSTATUS} ${__PS1_PYENV}${__PS1_RVM}\n${__PS1_USERNAME}${__PS1_PWD}\n$ &quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a screenshot of it in action:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="/static/images/Bash_PS1_screenshot.png" title="Bash Prompt Screenshot" /></p>
<p>Maybe it's too much information, but I find it useful. On the first line, the date is in yellow. My current Git branch is in green. My current Python virtual environment is in purple. My current Ruby version, patchlevel, and gemset is in red. On the next line, my username and hostname are in red, and my working directory is in blue.</p>
<p>To show the Git branch, you need to have the <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> <code>bash-completion</code> package installed, and you need to do the following in your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">if [ -f /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt.sh ]; then
    export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
    source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git-prompt.sh

  </div>
    <div class="date">Published January 31, 2013</div>
  <p>I order lots of stuff online, most of which gets shipped with a tracking number. I use <a href="https://junecloud.com">Junecloud's awesome Delivery Touch app for iOS</a> to track those shipments. Junecloud offers a couple of <a href="http://junecloud.com/support/delivery-status-ios/delivery-status-url-scheme.html">URLs to add new tracking numbers to their system</a> which will sync to their iOS apps (and dashboard widget).</p>
<p>I put together a simple Automator service that allows you to select a tracking number (for example, from an Amazon.com confirmation email), option-click on it, and select "Add Tracking Number to Deliveries" from your Services menu. This will open the Junecloud sync website and add your selected tracking number. Note, you will need a Junecloud sync account for this to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pwc3/deliveries-service">You can download the Automator service from Github</a>, or you can create it yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <em>Automator</em></li>
<li>Create a new <em>Service</em></li>
<li>Make sure the options show: <em>Service receives selected</em> <strong><em>text</em></strong> <em>in</em> <strong><em>any application</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Drag a <em>Run AppleScript</em> action to the area that says <em>Drag actions or files here to build your workflow.</em></li>
<li>Enter the following in the new <em>Run AppleScript</em> action:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="applescript">on run {input, parameters}
    set _url to &quot;https://junecloud.com/sync/grab/?no=&quot; &amp; input
    do shell script &quot;open &quot; &amp; _url
    return input
end run
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Save the service as "Add Tracking Number to Deliveries" (or whatever service name you prefer).</li>
</ol>
